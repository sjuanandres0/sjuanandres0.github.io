          This project was triggered by the Capstone Project of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program where I had to put in practise many of of the skills learned. The project topic was free so, due to the recent hype in Cryptocurrencies, I decided to work on a Bitcoin Price Predictor using Deep learning.

          In this project I analyzed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform and make recommendations to them about new articles I think they will like. For this purpose, I used NLTK library to process text data and provide recommendations based on Rank, User-User Collaborative Filtering, Content and Matrix Factorization.
          This project is part of the Udacity Nanodegree Program.
