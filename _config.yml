          This project was triggered by the Capstone Project of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program where I had to put in practise many of of the skills learned. The project topic was free so, due to the recent hype in Cryptocurrencies, I decided to work on a Bitcoin Price Predictor using Deep learning. 
#          Disclaimer: the model and predictions do not pretend to be used as financial advice. They were created for educational purposes and with a time constraint. Do not take financial decisions based on the results.  
#          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

           Got theory and hands-on experience in real world Data Science projects.   
#          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.
