  Hi, my name is Juan and I'm an <mark>Industrial Engineer</mark> keen on <mark>Data Science</mark>.

  I certainly don’t know everything but I can learn anything (or well... almost anything 🙃).

  I strongly believe things can always be improved. 

  Can-do and solution seeker mindset.
  
  Team player and motivated by challenges.

          This project was triggered by the Capstone Project of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program where I had to put into practice many of the skills learned. The project topic was free so, due to the recent hype in Cryptocurrencies, I decided to work on a Bitcoin Price Predictor using Deep Learning.

          ThuisBot is a script that periodically scraps websites gathering relevant information about new houses for sale and sends automatic messages via Telegram when a new house matches the set criteria (considering value, square meters, age of the property, energy label, among others). 
          Unfortunately, I can't disclose the code, but it's built using Scrapy, Pandas, Numpy, Requests, Regular Expression and GitHub Actions.
          The project was driven by a personal need.

          This project consists of an API that classifies disaster messages. 
          For this purpose, a Machine Learning model using NLTK was trained with a labelled dataset provided by [Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/), saved in a pickle file and embedded in a webapp using Flask and Heroku. 
          Users/pipelines are then able to use the trained model to classify messages according to the type of assistance required. 
          With supervised learning, a Machine Learning model using NLTK library was trained in a labelled dataset provided by Figure Eight. 
          This project was promoted/facilitated by Udacity in the Data Scientist program.

          This project was part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree where it was required to write a Data Analytics blog post from a topic of my choice. I decided to work on COVID-19 data trying to reply questions that were particularly interesting for me. This project was very useful to learn how to gather real world data in the huge internet and generate interactive visualizations with Plotly. Additionally, I used Numpy, Pandas, SKLearn, Missingno and Seaborn.

          This project consist of building a webapp to practise software engineering skills. 
          It consists of a tailormade COVID-19 Dashboard that updates automatically.
          It's hosted in Heroku and it's feeded from Our World in Data.

          In this project I analyzed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform and made recommendations to them about new articles I think they will like. For this purpose, I used NLTK library to process text data and provide recommendations based on Rank, User-User Collaborative Filtering, Content and Matrix Factorization.

          In this project I predicted the Hydrometry (river level) of River Arno (Italy) considering historical records of Rainfall and Temperature in different geographical points. The Machine Learning algorithm used was XGBoost. 
          This project is part of a Kaggle Analytics Competition.
